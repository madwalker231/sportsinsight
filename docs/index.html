    <h2 class="welcome-message">Welcome to the SportsInsight web application. This site is still in a early beta stage. If you are here then you have been chosen to be a beta tester.
      What is SportsInsight? SportsInsight is a end to end sports analytics pipeline that uses machine learning to make predictions about professional sports athletes, teams, 
      and much more. SportsInsight aims to bridge the connection between the technology and sports industry. Right now SportsInsight is at a crossroads. This application could be 
      used at an enterprise level by professional sports teams like the Dallas Maverick, Denver Broncos, New York Yankees, and many more. Or this application could be used by 
      sports fans in a fantasy sports league, like fantasy basket ball or football. Thats where you come in as a user tester, to help the SportsInsight team determine the 
      best course of action for this application. Your feedback will help shape the future of sports analytics in both the enterprise level and the fan level. Please explore and 
      interact with the site as much as you can. When you feel like you have explored enough please go to the link at the bottom of the page and fill out a quick survey to 
      provide the team with any and all feedback you have for us.
